# Gannett.cc

This is the code for the [Gannett.cc](https://gannett.cc) website, which lets anyone easily find Census population schedules by location in many US cities.

Gannett.cc is named after [Henry Gannett](https://www.census.gov/history/www/census_then_now/notable_alumni/henry_gannett.html), a geographer for the US Census in the 19th Century. His work with place names for the census led to the establishment of the [US Board of Geographic Names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Board_on_Geographic_Names), which he chaired for many years. This project is unrelated to the newspaper publisher.
