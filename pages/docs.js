          Every genealogist who has family in the United States after the mid-19th Century will have encountered <Link href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/wiki/United_States_Federal_Census#Enumeration_Districts">Enumeration Districts</Link> (EDs), even if they don't realize it. This is how counties are split up into smaller regions of a few hundred people, and the exact shape of each ED determines where you need to look to find records for people living at a certain address.
